Simple Calculator Test App

Calculates the value of two single-digit numbers.

If user performs more calculation by pressing an operator after inputting two numbers, program will run the calculation and move the result to the first index

Currently has an error with the usage of GridLayout.
Actual issues are probably: -Issue with Library Install for android.support.v7.widget.gridlayout
                            -Target SDK
                            
Still unable to fix Android issue
